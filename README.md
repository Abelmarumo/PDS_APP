# Abstract
Potential Driven Students(PDS) is a student structure established in the University Of Limpopo by students(I am one of them) in the school of mathematics and computer sciences. PDS assists fellow students in the school of mathematics and computer sciences with their modules in terms of extra classes. However, before getting help from this organization, the student should first fill a manual form and then deposit some fees in the organization's bank account. This manual process for the enrollment of students is an inconvenience in many ways. Among these inconveniences, one of them is the poor data management of the students.

PDS app is built(by Marumo AM) to champion most of these challenges encountered by the organization. The app allows students to enroll and pay on their mobile smartphones. The app is built with flutter, stripe payment gateway, and firebase.
